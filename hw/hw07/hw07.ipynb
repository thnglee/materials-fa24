    "Consider a six-sided die that we roll 6,000 times. If the die is fair, we would expect that each face comes up $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the time. By random chance, a fair die won't always result in equal proportions (that is, we won't get exactly 1,000 of each face). However, if we suspect that the die might be unfair based on the data, we can conduct a hypothesis test using TVD to compare the expected [$\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$] distribution to what is actually observed.\n",
