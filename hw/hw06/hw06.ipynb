    "### Simulating 10 Bets on Red\n",
    "Roulette wheels are set up so that each time they are spun, the winning pocket is equally likely to be any of the 38 pockets regardless of the results of all other spins. Let's see what would happen if we decided to bet one dollar on red each round.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3.** Create a table `ten_bets` by sampling the table `wheel` to simulate 10 spins of the roulette wheel. Your table should have the same three column labels as in `wheel`. Once you've created that table, set `sum_bets` to your net gain in all 10 bets, assuming that you bet one dollar on red each time. **(4 points)**\n",
