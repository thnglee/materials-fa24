For the sake of these questions, we are treating each menu item's rating the same as its respective restaurant's, as we do not have the rating of every single item at these restaurants. You do not need to worry about this fact, but we thought to mention it!\n",

    "Create a table with two columns: the first column include the **names of the burritos** and the second column should contain the **average overall rating** of that burrito across restaurants. **In your calculations, you should only compare burritos that contain the word \"California\".** For example, there are \"California\" burritos, \"California Breakfast\" burritos, \"California Surf And Turf\" burritos, etc. **(9 Points)**\n",
